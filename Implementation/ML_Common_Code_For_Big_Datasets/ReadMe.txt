******************* The Machine Learning Common Code for Big Datasets *************************

The big datasets which contain 2500 images in each application where processed in batches of 500 images to perform the pre-processing and feature extraction components of the Machine Learning module due to the hardware limitations and capacities of the machine used for the project. 

The images (in batches of 500 files) were processed using the code given and the features extracted were stored in .csv files which were then uploaded manually to a cloud storage (Google Drive) and accessed by the respective .ipynb files to carry out the rest of the analysis using the extracted features.
