The Machine Learning Common Code for Big Datasets

The big datasets which contain 2500 images in each application
where processed in batches of 500 images to perform the 
pre-processing and feature extraction components of the 
Machine Learning module due to the hardware limitations and 
capacities of the machine used for the project.
